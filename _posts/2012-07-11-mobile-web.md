<p class="intro">Before NPR decided to embark on a responsive redesign for our member stations' web platform, we created a mobile-only version which we could learn from without expending too much effort. In a few weeks, I designed a clean, usable mobile-optimized site that elevated the listening experience while still respecting the large amount of text content that was present throughout the sites.</p>


### Elevate the live streams

We wanted to make listening prominent, and enable users to easily find and listen to a station's primary live stream (many stations have several, sometimes many). On the other hand, we didn't want to make the experience all about listening â€” because stations have lots of other content. After some trial and error working with real-world public radio listeners, we settled on a clear, prominent button, "Listen Live," followed by a stream of posts.

### Make it easy for stations

It's a reality of the public media world that resources are scarce. Mobile might be important, but it doesn't mean that a station has anyone who can be assigned to managing it. We needed a system that would be easy for stations to handle with minimal administration. Given that, I designed a simple way for stations to brand themselves. They could upload a logo/tagline lockup; select a couple of brand colors; input their stream feed URLs; and be on their way.
