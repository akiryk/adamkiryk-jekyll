<p class="intro">I worked at Arnold Worldwide from 2005 to 2011, where I was promoted from art director to senior art director to associate creative director along the way. Following are brief descriptions of some of the projects I led.</p>

**Carnival**: Over the course of a couple years, I worked on various project and campaigns for Carnival, including their website; a rebranding campaign; micro-sites focused on different aspects of the cruise experience; and online advertising. I spent time on their ships, interacted with vacationers, and art directed photo shoots of the accommodations. Learn about the  [*Didja Ever* campaign](/portfolio/2010/12/01/didja-ever/).

**OceanSpray**: I helped OceanSpray through two of their website redesigns, learning about their brand, understanding their customers, and presenting to their marketing department.

**RadioShack**: I worked on a variety of digital experiences for RadioShack, from holiday gift guides and online advertising to micro-sites and brand-building sites. The example below was part of a campaign aimed at fortifying RadioShack's reputation as a place to get the weird electronic bits and pieces that maker-type people use to create things. I liked the idea that we could help a community of like-minded people share ideas and make cool or quirky things.

**Progressive**: Progressive Insurance is in the business of selling their product based on how cheap and easy it is to sign up, so I spent a good deal of time working on ways to make it easier for people to quickly get a quote — through ads, emails, and on their website. The music mixing mini-app below was a fun little project we ran as an interactive ad on the Fox American Idol awards website. Users could create their own music mixes using sounds from the (hopefully) iconic Progressive emergency response vehicle which they called IRV.
