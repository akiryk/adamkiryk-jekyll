<p class="intro">I worked at Arnold Worldwide from 2005 to 2011, being promoted from art director to senior art director to associate creative director along the way.</p>

Following are some snapshots of some of the projects I led, with links to further information.

### Carnival
I worked on various projects for Carnival, including their website; a Facebook contest app; micro-sites; and online advertising. In the examples below, I was responsible for concept, design, and illustration.
