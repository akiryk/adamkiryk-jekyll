[Columnar](http://adamkiryk.com/columnar/prod/) is a tool I made for generating flexbox-based grids. To be honest, it was mainly a way for me to try out Grunt, which I'd wanted an excuse to play with, paired with a deeper dive into working with flexbox.

I created a nice little interface for setting the number of columns, adjusting gutter width, and dragging the columns as wide or narrow as youâ€™d like. My script watches for changes to the UI, and modifies the markup and CSS accordingly. The markup that I output is actually quite simple, but it exposes how easy flexbox can be. <a href="http://adamkiryk.com/columnar/prod/">Check it out.</a>
