<p class="intro">In 2014/15, we redesigned Core Publisher, NPR's website platform used by about 160 member stations.</p>

I was involved in the project from early-stage research through design and implementation. One of this project's major challenges was to achieve our objectives cheaply, easily, and relatively quickly, and — although it remains imperfect in certain key ways — the new responsive design was hugely successful. It helped small and mid-sized stations improve and increase their digital presense and reach a larger mobile audience.

The examples below show a post page that accommodates an ad but remains fairly clean and readable; a home page that demonstrates some of the flexibility we gave stations to highlight editorial and promotional content; and a sampling of sketches from various points in our research and explorations.

Some example stations using this web platform:

* [Michigan Radio](http://michiganradio.org/)
* [Nashville Public Radio](http://nashvillepublicradio.org/)
* [KUOW Seattle News & Information](http://kuow.org/)
