### Carnival

Art direction of people and places aboard Carnival ships for various uses including in print and digital ads, brochures, and for internal communications. The theme, not surprisingly: fun!

### RadioShack Red Chair Campaign

A holiday campaign featuring people sitting in a red chair, asking for the gifts they most wanted. The idea? Evoke Santa's chair, but make people — and their dream-gifts — the centerpiece. We made dozens of these with different people and different products.

Below are photos of the original image (someone in a chair with a product) and various ads that made use of those images.

*Synched Dormroom* — a student navigates his messy, hectic dormroom with the help of RadioShack know-how.

*Santa's Diner* — A family finds a mysterious place thanks to a new GPS device from RadioShack.

{% youtube https://youtu.be/dyiGEnez-UU %}
*Salute The Roadies* — One of several videos for an online campaign run on RollingStone.com celebrating roadies. Why? Because, like RadioShack, roadies are always there to do necessary but often overlooked work.

Some examples of images from the Roadie campaign used in ads or in preparation for making ads...

Part of a project I did when at Posttool Design for a Stanford University research group, I art directed a photographer in public schools around San Jose.
