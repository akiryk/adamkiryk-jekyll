<h2 class="no-margin-top">Hello, I’m Adam.</h2>

I have a deep understanding of visual design and user experience, I know css, html, and javascript — and I have years of experience.

I think I’m pretty good at what I do.

Check out some of my work here — from my time at [NPR](/portfolio/2015/12/12/npr/), [Arnold](/portfolio/2011/02/10/arnold-worldwide/), or just look through my [portfolio](/portfolio-list/) or [resume](/resume). Send an email if you have questions: adamkiryk at gmail dot com.
