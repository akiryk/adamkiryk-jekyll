<h2 class="no-margin-top">Hello, I’m Adam, a designer and front-end-developer.</h2>

I have a deep understanding of visual design and user experience, I write css, html, and javascript, and I’ve been doing it for years.

I think I’m pretty good at what I do.

Check out some of my work here, and drop me a line if you have questions. (adamkiryk@gmail.com)
